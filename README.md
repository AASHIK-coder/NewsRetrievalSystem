# News Retrieval System

The News Retrieval System is a Python-based project designed for the efficient retrieval and analysis of news articles. Utilizing advanced preprocessing and retrieval algorithms, this system allows for quick search and retrieval of news data based on user queries. Additionally, the system includes functionalities for data visualization to aid in the analysis of the retrieved news articles.

## Installation and Setup

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. Follow these steps in your terminal:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url> NewsRetrievalSystem
cd NewsRetrievalSystem

# (Optional) Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

### Preprocessing

Prepare the news data for retrieval by running:

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

This script cleans the data, tokenizes text, and performs other necessary preprocessing steps.

### Retrieval

Search for news articles based on a query by executing:

```bash
python retrieval.py
```

Input your query when prompted, and the script will return the most relevant news articles.

### Visualization

Visualize the data to uncover insights:

```bash
python graph.py
```

This will generate graphs based on the retrieved news data, aiding in the analysis.

### Running the System

To run the entire News Retrieval System, use:

```bash
python main.py
```

This central script orchestrates the preprocessing, retrieval, and visualization processes.
